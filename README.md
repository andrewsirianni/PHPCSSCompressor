PHPCSSCompressor
================

ABOUT:

In larger projects (or websites) it can be difficult to keep your CSS code in check and make it easy to manage.  While at the same time, the process of compressing your code each time you load a new version can be cumbersome.

I wrote this CSS class for PHP some time ago to enable me to maintain separate CSS files for different sections of my website.  It allows me to keep simple and easy to modify files on my system, but it combines and compresses these files at run-time when called on a development or production server.  A great way to minify your CSS and combine all your CSS files in one go on the fly.

I hope you find this useful!
